--4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.
select sum(po) as putouts,
case when pos = 'OF' then 'Outfield'
when pos IN ('SS','1B','2B','3B') then 'Infield'
else 'Battery' end as position

--5. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends?
select (yearid)/10*10 as Decade, (round(sum(cast(so as numeric))/sum(cast(g as numeric)),2)) as strikeouts_game, (round(sum(cast(hr as numeric))/sum(cast(g as numeric)),2)) as hr_game
from teams
where yearid >=1920
group by decade
order by decade;
-- both the strikeouts per game and the homeruns per games have increased significantly over the last 100 years
